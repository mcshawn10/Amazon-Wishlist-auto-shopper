# Amazon-auto-shopper
Amazon bot that takes in your desired items and automatically adds to cart

This project utilizes the Selenium framework to do en masse shopping for the the user. 
User will need to input via the Terminal how many items that they wish to buy as well as the item names themselves.

For the purposes of this project and your wallet, the program does not automatically buy the items that you input.
However the code can easily be manipulated to automatically purchase your goods. 

UPDATE June 30, 2021

This bot has been updated to scrape the search page for the cheapest item. 
However, it is possible that the deired item will not be added to cart, since the bot looks for the CHEAPEST item
and Amazon lists several items to buy no matter what you search up.
Possible interferences with the bot are: sponsored items and insurance proposals from Amazon
The program works for simple items such as poster or soccer balls.
